# Feedback Patterns

Common feedback patterns and how to respond to them.

## Additive Feedback

User wants MORE of something.

| Feedback | Interpretation | Action |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| "Add more wonder" | Increase philosophical implications | Add metaphors, implication sentences, reality-questioning |
| "More sensory" | Increase concrete details | Add physical sensations, textures, temperatures |
| "More examples" | Increase illustration | Add concrete cases, analogies, scenarios |
| "More authority" | Increase confidence | Remove hedges, strengthen claims, add certainty language |
| "More personality" | Increase voice markers | Add signature phrases, distinctive patterns |
| "More flow" | Increase connective tissue | Add transitions, linking phrases, smoother paragraph breaks |
| "More punch" | Increase impact moments | Add short declarative sentences, bold statements |
| "More depth" | Increase exploration | Expand on implications, add layers, follow tangents |

**Implementation pattern:**
1. Identify target dimension
2. Locate relevant section in active profile
3. Amplify that dimension's application
4. Re-draft affected content
5. Note adjustment in output metadata

## Subtractive Feedback

User wants LESS of something.

| Feedback | Interpretation | Action |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| "Less dense" | Reduce paragraph weight | Shorten paragraphs, add white space, one idea per paragraph |
| "Fewer metaphors" | Reduce rhetorical devices | Remove figurative language, favor direct statements |
| "Less formal" | Reduce formality | Add contractions, casual phrasing, relaxed structure |
| "Less hedging" | Reduce uncertainty markers | Remove "perhaps," "maybe," "might" |
| "Simpler" | Reduce complexity | Shorter sentences, common words, clear structure |
| "Less technical" | Reduce jargon | Replace domain terms with accessible language |
| "Shorter" | Reduce length | Cut redundancy, tighten prose, eliminate tangents |
| "Less intense" | Reduce emotional weight | Soften language, reduce urgency markers |

**Implementation pattern:**
1. Identify target dimension
2. Locate instances of that dimension in draft
3. Remove or soften those instances
4. Re-draft for coherence
5. Note adjustment in output metadata

## Shifting Feedback

User wants to MOVE in a direction.

| Feedback | From | To | Action |
|----------|------|----|---------|
| "Warmer" | analytical/cold | personal/warm | Add direct address, emotional vocabulary |
| "Cooler" | personal/warm | analytical/cold | Remove emotional markers, increase objectivity |
| "More direct" | hedged/nuanced | bold/clear | Lead with claims, reduce qualification |
| "More nuanced" | bold/clear | hedged/nuanced | Add qualification, acknowledge complexity |
| "Faster pace" | measured/slow | urgent/quick | Shorten sentences, reduce elaboration |
| "Slower pace" | urgent/quick | measured/slow | Lengthen sentences, add development |

**Implementation pattern:**
1. Identify current position on spectrum
2. Identify target position
3. Adjust relevant dimensions to move toward target
4. Re-draft with new calibration
5. Note shift in output metadata

## Profile-Switching Feedback

User wants to change the active profile.

| Feedback | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "Switch to [profile]" | Load new profile, restart section with new voice |
| "More like [profile] now" | Transition toward that profile's characteristics |
| "Forget [profile], use [other]" | Abandon current blend, load new profile |
| "Add [profile] to the mix" | Introduce additional profile to blend |
| "Drop [profile] from blend" | Remove profile's influence, retain others |

**Implementation pattern:**
1. Acknowledge the switch
2. Load requested profile(s)
3. Determine transition point (immediate vs. gradual)
4. Re-draft from transition point
5. Update blend documentation

## Section-Specific Feedback

User wants different treatment for different parts.

| Feedback | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "The opening needs more punch" | Re-draft opening with increased impact |
| "Middle section drags" | Tighten middle, increase pace |
| "Ending falls flat" | Re-draft closing with stronger landing |
| "Use [profile] just for the intro" | Section-switch, apply profile to specific section |

**Implementation pattern:**
1. Identify target section
2. Isolate that section for revision
3. Apply requested adjustment
4. Ensure transitions still work
5. Note section-specific changes

## Compound Feedback

User gives multiple directions at once.

**Example:** "More wonder but shorter sentences"

**Parsing:**
1. Split into discrete adjustments
2. Check for conflicts between adjustments
3. Apply sequentially if no conflicts
4. Ask for priority if conflicts exist

**Conflict example:** "More depth but shorter" - these can conflict.

```

📍 FEEDBACK CLARIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════

"More depth but shorter" creates tension:
- Depth often requires elaboration
- Shorter means less elaboration

Options:
1. **Depth in fewer words** - More implication, less explanation
2. **Selective depth** - Go deep on fewer points
3. **Prioritize depth** - Accept slightly longer output
4. **Prioritize brevity** - Accept slightly less depth

## Approval Feedback

User indicates satisfaction.

| Feedback | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "Perfect" / "This is right" | Lock current voice settings, continue |
| "Continue" / "Keep going" | Maintain current blend, proceed to next section |
| "Yes" / "Good" | Confirm current direction, proceed |
| "Save this blend" | Document current settings for future use |

**On approval:**
1. Note approved voice configuration
2. Maintain settings for subsequent content
3. Only deviate if user requests change
