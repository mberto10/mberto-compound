# Analysis Dimensions: Deep Methodology

Detailed methodology for analyzing each of the 12 profile dimensions.

## 1. Voice Architecture

The fundamental structure of how the writer presents themselves.

### Pronoun Analysis

**What to track:**
- First-person singular (I, me, my): Personal, intimate
- First-person plural (we, us, our): Inclusive, collaborative
- Second-person (you, your): Direct, instructional
- Third-person (one, they, it): Distant, formal
- Impersonal constructions: Academic, objective

**Calculation method:**
1. Count pronoun occurrences across all samples
2. Calculate percentage distribution
3. Note context variations (does "we" appear only in certain topics?)
4. Identify the default choice vs. strategic departures

### Perspective Consistency

**Questions to answer:**
- Does the writer maintain consistent perspective?
- When do they shift perspective and why?
- What triggers a move from "I" to "we" or "you"?

### Narrative Distance

**Scale:**
1. **Intimate**: Shares personal thoughts, vulnerabilities, inner dialogue
2. **Conversational**: Friendly, shares experiences, but maintains some boundary
3. **Professional**: Warm but boundaried, focused on content over self
4. **Analytical**: Detached, objective, minimal personal presence
5. **Distant**: Academic, impersonal, almost invisible author

**Indicators:**
- Personal anecdote frequency
- Emotional disclosure level
- Use of "I think" vs. "Research shows"
- Presence of inner dialogue or thought processes

### Persona Type

**Categories:**
- **Guide**: Leads reader through material, "let me show you"
- **Peer**: Shares journey, "here's what I learned"
- **Expert**: Authoritative delivery, "here's what you need to know"
- **Storyteller**: Narrative-driven, "let me tell you about"
- **Analyst**: Data-driven, "the evidence suggests"
- **Provocateur**: Challenges assumptions, "what if everything you know is wrong"

## 2. Tonal Signature

The emotional coloring and attitude pervading the writing.

### Baseline Tone Identification

Read samples and identify the dominant emotional quality:
- Optimistic / Pessimistic / Neutral
- Serious / Playful / Mixed
- Warm / Cool / Variable
- Urgent / Relaxed / Measured

**Method:**
1. Read opening paragraphs - what's the immediate feel?
2. Read conclusions - what's the parting impression?
3. Sample middle sections - does tone shift?
4. Identify the "resting state" tone

### Tonal Range

**Narrow range**: Writer maintains consistent tone regardless of topic
**Moderate range**: Tone adapts to content but within recognizable bounds
**Wide range**: Writer dramatically shifts tone based on context

### Humor Analysis

**Type identification:**
- **Dry/Deadpan**: Understated, requires reader to catch it
- **Playful**: Light, fun, often self-deprecating
- **Sardonic**: Biting, critical, ironic
- **Wit**: Clever wordplay, intellectual humor
- **Absurdist**: Unexpected, surreal, non-sequitur
- **None**: Humor absent or incidental

**Frequency tracking:**
- Count humor instances per 1000 words
- Rare: <1 per 1000 words
- Occasional: 1-3 per 1000 words
- Frequent: >3 per 1000 words

**Placement patterns:**
- Openings only (hooks)
- Transitions (tension relief)
- Throughout (consistent lightness)
- Conclusions (memorable endings)
- Parentheticals (asides)

### Formality Spectrum

**1-10 Scale:**
1-2: Extremely casual, slang, incomplete sentences
3-4: Conversational, contractions, friendly
5-6: Professional casual, accessible but polished
7-8: Formal, proper grammar, limited contractions
9-10: Academic/legal, complex structures, no informality

## 3. Structural Patterns

How the writer organizes and presents information.

### Opening Strategy Analysis

**Common types:**
- **Hook question**: "What if I told you..."
- **Bold statement**: "Everything changes today."
- **Anecdote**: "Last Tuesday, I discovered..."
- **Statistic**: "73% of people don't realize..."
- **Scene-setting**: "The office was quiet..."
- **Definition**: "Let's start with what X really means."
- **Provocation**: "You've been doing it wrong."
- **Context**: "In the world of X, Y has always..."

**Analysis method:**
1. Catalog opening type for each sample
2. Identify primary pattern (most frequent)
3. Note secondary patterns
4. Extract 2-3 exemplar openings

### Paragraph Construction

**Typical length:**
- Count sentences per paragraph across samples
- Calculate average and range
- Note if length varies by section type

**Density assessment:**
- Sparse: Short paragraphs, lots of white space, one idea per paragraph
- Moderate: 3-5 sentences, developed ideas
- Dense: Long paragraphs, multiple ideas interwoven

**Internal structure:**
- Topic sentence + support
- Narrative flow
- Evidence sandwich
- Stream of consciousness
- Varied/unpredictable

### Transition Analysis

**Explicit transitions:**
- "However," "Furthermore," "In contrast"
- "First... Second... Third"
- "Now let's turn to..."

**Implicit transitions:**
- Semantic links without connectors
- Paragraph breaks carrying meaning
- Thematic echoes

**Method:**
1. Count explicit transition words/phrases
2. Analyze paragraph-to-paragraph connections
3. Calculate explicit vs. implicit ratio

### Closing Patterns

**Types:**
- **Summary**: Recaps key points
- **Call to action**: Directs reader to next step
- **Full circle**: Returns to opening theme
- **Forward look**: Points to future implications
- **Reflection**: Invites deeper thought
- **Provocation**: Leaves with challenge
- **Quiet landing**: Gentle conclusion, no fanfare

## 4. Vocabulary Fingerprint

### Lexical Sophistication

**Assessment method:**
1. Sample 100 content words (excluding articles, prepositions)
2. Categorize by frequency tier:
   - Common (top 1000 English words)
   - Intermediate (1000-5000)
   - Advanced (5000-20000)
   - Rare/specialized (20000+)
3. Calculate distribution

**Levels:**
- Accessible: >80% common words
- Moderate: 60-80% common words
- Sophisticated: 40-60% common words
- Technical: <40% common words, domain-heavy

### Signature Phrase Extraction

**Method:**
1. Identify phrases appearing in 2+ samples
2. Note unusual collocations
3. Flag phrases that feel distinctively "them"
4. Look for sentence starters that repeat

**Examples of signature phrases:**
- "Here's the thing:"
- "The real question is..."
- "What most people miss is..."
- "To put it simply,"

### Power Word Identification

Words the writer gravitates toward for emphasis:
- Track frequently emphasized words
- Note words in key positions (openings, conclusions)
- Identify recurring intensifiers

### Avoided Constructions

**Method:**
1. Note constructions common in similar writing but absent here
2. Look for consistent avoidance patterns
3. Distinguish intentional avoidance from coincidence (3+ samples)

**Common avoidances:**
- Passive voice
- Jargon
- Certain intensifiers ("very," "really")
- Clichés
- Hedge words
