# Quality Rubric Reference

Examples and patterns for reviewing writing against taste profiles.

## Voice Match Examples

### Fundamental Mismatch

**Indicators:**
- Wrong pronoun system (profile uses "we", draft uses "I" throughout)
- Opposite tonal register (profile is playful, draft is stiff)
- Zero signature phrases present
- Vocabulary level completely off

**Example:**
> Profile: Steven Pinker (conversational authority, "we" perspective, intellectual playfulness)
> Draft: "One must consider the ramifications of cognitive overload when utilizing productivity methodologies."
> Diagnosis: Sounds like an academic paper, not Pinker. Rewrite with "we" perspective, accessible vocabulary, and a concrete example.

### Partial Match

**Indicators:**
- Some correct elements but inconsistent
- Signature moves feel forced
- Tone wavers between matching and not

**Example:**
> Profile: Pinker
> Draft starts well but switches to passive voice and jargon mid-piece
> Diagnosis: Voice established in opening but lost. Maintain conversational authority throughout.

### Strong Match

**Indicators:**
- Correct voice throughout
- 2+ signature moves present naturally
- Tone consistent
- Author would approve with minor notes

### Indistinguishable

**Indicators:**
- Voice feels effortless, not performed
- Signature moves emerge naturally
- Captures not just mechanics but spirit

## Common Weakness Patterns

### Hook Weaknesses

**Generic opening:**
> "In today's fast-paced world, productivity is more important than ever."
> Fix: Lead with specific, counterintuitive claim matching profile's opening strategy.

**Solid but not distinctive:**
> "I spent three months tracking every minute of my day. The results surprised me."
> Fix: The "surprised me" is vague. What specifically? Profile demands specificity.

### Voice Drift

**Starts strong, loses voice:**
> First two paragraphs match profile, then drift into generic prose
> Fix: Re-anchor to profile at each section transition. Check signature moves.

**Forced signatures:**
> Signature phrases inserted awkwardly instead of emerging naturally
> Fix: Let voice come from underlying patterns (rhythm, vocabulary, structure), not surface phrases.

### Tone Issues

**Too safe:**
> Technically correct voice but missing the author's edge
> Fix: Look at profile's authority stance and distinctive markers. What makes them *them*?

**Emotional mismatch:**
> Profile is warm and wonder-driven, draft is clinical
> Fix: Check emotional register dimensions. Add the profile's characteristic warmth/wonder.

## Publish Test Reasoning Examples

### Would Be Embarrassed

> "The piece reads like a committee wrote it. The voice shifts from conversational to corporate-speak in section 2, uses three anti-pattern phrases, and the conclusion sounds like a press release."

### Would Be Neutral

> "The voice is about 70% there—tone is right and structure works—but missing the author's distinctive edge. No signature moments, generic examples, conclusion summarizes rather than punches."

### Would Be Proud

> "Captures both the intellectual rigor and the playful accessibility that defines the voice. Opening hooks immediately, signature moves appear at natural transition points, examples are specific and surprising, conclusion lands with a callback."
