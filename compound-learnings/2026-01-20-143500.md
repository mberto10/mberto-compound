## Session Context
- Date: 2026-01-20
- Plugins used: langdock-dev (parallel-actions skill, langdock-api-operations skill)
- Focus: Debugging Langdock action Promise.all validation error

## Summary
User needed help debugging a Langdock action that used `Promise.all` to parallelize multiple `ld.request` calls. The langdock-dev plugin's parallel-actions skill was consulted, which documents `Promise.all` as a valid pattern. However, the Langdock runtime rejected this pattern with the error "Each `ld.request` call must be awaited or have a `.then()` chain". The solution was to refactor to sequential awaits, but this reveals a documentation-reality mismatch in the plugin.

## Learnings

### Rules
- Langdock runtime requires explicit await on each `ld.request` call; `Promise.all` wrapper is rejected by static validator.

### Feature Requests
- None identified

### Fixes
- parallel-actions skill documents `Promise.all` with `ld.request` as valid pattern but Langdock runtime rejects it; update skill to reflect actual runtime constraints or add clear warning.

## Proposed Changes

### langdock-dev/skills/parallel-actions
- **File:** skills/parallel-actions/SKILL.md
- **Change type:** update
- **Description:** Add prominent warning that Langdock runtime may reject `Promise.all` wrapping `ld.request` calls despite the pattern working in other JavaScript contexts. Document the sequential await workaround as the safe alternative when parallel execution causes validation errors.
- **Priority:** high

## Raw Observations
- The error message ("Each `ld.request` call must be awaited or have a `.then()` chain") suggests Langdock does static analysis of action code before execution
- This static analysis doesn't recognize `Promise.all` as properly awaiting the promises
- The parallel-actions skill has extensive documentation on combining multiple API calls efficiently, but this fundamental runtime constraint isn't mentioned
- User's actual use case (exporting usage data from 3 endpoints then downloading CSVs) is exactly the kind of workflow the parallel-actions skill is designed for
- The workaround (sequential awaits) works but loses the parallelism benefit
- It's unclear if this is a Langdock bug, an intentional constraint, or version-specific behavior
