# Compound Learning: weekly-email formatting rules

## Session Context
- Date: 2026-01-19
- Plugins used: work-toolkit (weekly-email command)
- Focus: Email formatting preferences - no Blocker section if keine, no --- separators, underlined project headings

## Summary
Used /weekly-email to generate KW03 Lenkungsausschuss update. Output included "Blocker: Keine" for projects without blockers, used --- separators between sections, and ## headings for projects. User wants cleaner format without unnecessary elements.

## Learnings

### Rules
- Omit Blocker section entirely when there are no blockers (don't write "Blocker: Keine"). [src:2026-01-19] [type:rule]
- Use underlined project names instead of ## markdown headings for email output. [src:2026-01-19] [type:rule]
- Don't use --- horizontal rules to separate project sections in the email. [src:2026-01-19] [type:rule]

## Proposed Changes

### work-toolkit: weekly-email command
- **File:** commands/weekly-email.md
- **Change type:** update
- **Description:** Update email template in step 4 to:
  1. Remove --- separators between projects
  2. Change `## [Project Name]` to `__[Project Name]__` (underlined/bold)
  3. Make Blocker section conditional - only include if blockers exist
- **Priority:** high

## Raw Observations
The current template is markdown-centric (## headings, ---) but the output goes into email which renders differently. Cleaner plain-text formatting with bold/underlined names and no separators reads better in email clients. This is a frontier-shifting learning because it improves both output quality AND reduces generation time (fewer conditional elements to write).
