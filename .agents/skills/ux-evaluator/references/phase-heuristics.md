# Phase Heuristics

Use these phase-specific heuristics during UX evaluation. Each phase should be checked for clarity, efficiency, feedback, recovery, and accessibility.

## DISCOVER ("Why should I care?")
- Value proposition is obvious within the first screen.
- Primary CTA is visible and unambiguous.
- Trust signals exist (social proof, security cues).
- Audience fit is clear (who this is for).
- No jargon before value is established.

## SIGN UP ("Let me in")
- Signup path is easy to find and start.
- Form fields are minimal and justified.
- Error messages are clear and actionable.
- Password rules and requirements are visible.
- Alternate login methods are clear (if available).
- Trust/security cues are present at the decision point.

## ONBOARD ("Help me get started")
- Next step is always obvious.
- Progress is visible (step count or milestones).
- Default options make sense for new users.
- Terminology matches the target user.
- Users can skip or defer non-critical setup.

## ACTIVATE ("Aha! This is useful")
- Time to first value is short.
- The first success moment is explicit and celebrated.
- The system provides guidance at the moment of need.
- Users understand why the result matters.
- Clear path from first value to repeatable usage.

## ADOPT ("This is how I use it")
- The core loop is discoverable and repeatable.
- Efficiency improves with use (shortcuts, defaults).
- User can understand system state at a glance.
- Error recovery does not break the loop.
- The workflow scales for real data volume.

## ENGAGE ("I check this regularly")
- Reasons to return are clear and relevant.
- Notifications or reminders are useful, not noisy.
- Users can quickly resume where they left off.
- Time-to-action on return is short.

## RETAIN ("I cannot work without this")
- Ongoing value is demonstrated over time.
- Users feel ownership of data or outcomes.
- Switching costs or unique value are clear.
- Reliability and trust are high (no surprises).

## EXPAND ("I want more")
- Upgrade paths are contextual and fair.
- Advanced features are discoverable without clutter.
- Cross-sell or add-ons fit the workflow.
- Referral or sharing mechanisms are simple and transparent.
