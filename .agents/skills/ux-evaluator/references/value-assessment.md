# Value Assessment

Use this framework to assess product fit and value delivery, especially for MCP evaluations.

## Key Questions
1. Does the product deliver the stated value proposition?
2. Is it better than the user's alternatives?
3. Does the user reach an "aha" moment quickly?
4. Would the user return after the first session?
5. Would the user recommend it?

## Product Fit Rating

- **Strong Fit**: Core intent is fulfilled with clear, repeatable value. User would return.
- **Moderate Fit**: Partial value delivered but important gaps remain.
- **Weak Fit**: Value is unclear or inconsistent.
- **No Fit**: User intent is not met.

## Evidence Checklist
- Concrete outcomes achieved
- Time to first value
- Clarity of results
- Ability to iterate or refine
- Trust and reliability signals

## Recommended Wording

vs. Alternatives: [Better/Same/Worse]
Would Return: [Definitely/Probably/Unlikely/No]
